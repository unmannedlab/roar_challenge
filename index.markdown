Welcome to the **The Outdoors Semantic and Odometry Challenge**! Participate in competitive challenges aimed at pushing the boundaries of off-road autonomy. The challenges will use the newly developed dataset: [The Great Outdoors Dataset: Off-Road Multi-Modal Dataset](http://www.unmannedlab.org/the-great-outdoors-dataset/).

## Challenges Overview
We will host three challenges:
- **Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation**
- **Novel View Synthesis (NVS)**
- **Multimodal Off-Road Odometry**

Explore each challenge and submit your solutions to advance off-road robotics!
